## Overview
#### Tree 
A tree is an Abstract Data Type (ADT) where each node has as many children as it likes. In a Tree their may not be any loops, where children are able to reference any ancestor. In Tree's connections between nodes are called edges, and Nodes without children are called Leafs. The top of a tree is called the root, and the Depth of a tree is the maximum number of edges from the root to a leaf.
